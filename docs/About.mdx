# What is Pokemonorepo?
---
A full-stack pokédex project using Nx, NestJS, and Next.js

## Background Stories
**Pokemonorepo** is created as a mini portfolio project as well as a learning medium for myself and others who are starting to learn about full-stack web development.

### Why a mini portfolio project? 
Because through this project, I can showcase a miniature representation of my technical skills in tackling full-stack web development challenges with source code that I write and organize openly. This is something I cannot fully demonstrate through the projects at my previous companies. 

### Why a learning medium? 
Because with open source code, anyone can analyze how my code works and provide corrections if there are areas that can still be improved, offering valuable insights for everyone.

### Why choose a Pokédex?
A project theme like Pokédex offers a more enjoyable experience while providing space for exploration with various technical features, such as search functionality, data filtering, pagination, and other features that challenge me to be creative.
